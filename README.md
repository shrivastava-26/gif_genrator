Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project and run it on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v12 or higher) and npm installed on your machine.
Giphy API Key (You can get one by signing up at Giphy Developers).
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-gif-generator.git
cd random-gif-generator
Install dependencies:

Set up Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS is already set up in this project. If you need to reconfigure or customize, follow these steps:

Generate a Tailwind configuration file if not already done:

bash
Copy code
npx tailwindcss init
Import Tailwind CSS in the src/index.css file:

css
Copy code
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Replace the Giphy API Key:

Go to the src/components/GifGenerator.js file.

Replace 'YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY' with your actual Giphy API key:

javascript
Copy code
const apiKey = 'YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY';  // Replace this with your Giphy API key
Running the App
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

Build the App for Production
To create a production-ready build of the app, run:

Dependencies
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

How It Works
Giphy API: The app uses the Giphy API to fetch random GIFs.
Axios: Axios is used to make GET requests to the Giphy API.
React Hooks: The useState hook is used to manage the state of the GIF URL.
